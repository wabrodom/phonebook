# Full Stack Open Part3 x Part11 
## Programming a server with NodeJS and Express x CI/CD
The Phonebook no user in Part 3 was simple exercise. However, I add some features such as user functionality. Unfortunately despite a lot of effort, the output was almost look like the user in part4 and part5 bloglist, with some state management in part6-7...

I used built-in React useContext and @tanstack/react-query library to maintain server state on the front end, then adding node:test and Playwright e2e tests. To be blunt using the material from part4 and part5 to complete Part11 CI/CD maybe more simple. A good thing that is now I have a pipeline to help developing an average project to show in the future. 

It took quiet hours/days to prepare this to be readied for Part11 CI/CD
