# Full Stack Open Part3 x Part11 
## Programming a server with NodeJS and Express x CI/CD
The Phonebook in Part 3 is simple exercise. However, I add some features such as user functionality, by utilizing the built-in React useContext and some react-query to maintain server state on the front end, then adding node:test and Playwright e2e tests, 

it take quiet hours/days to prepare it to be readied for Part11 CI/CD
